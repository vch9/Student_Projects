(** * Generating the exact set of derivatives of a regexp *)

(** In Finiteness.v, we've built an over-approximation of these
    derivatives. Now, let's be exact. *)

Module RegExplore (Letter : FiniteOrderedType).
Include FiniteDerivs(Letter).

Implicit Type a : Letter.t.

(** From a given regexp r, the set of all [canon (r/a)] for all
    possible letters a. *)

Definition allderiv1 r :=

Lemma allderiv1_in r x :
  REs.In x (allderiv1 r) <-> exists a, x = canon (r/a).
Proof.
Admitted.

(** We proceed via a graph exploration. Nodes are regexps, edges are
    letters, there is an edge [a] from [r] to [s] if [canon (r/a) = s].
    We start with our initial regexp, and we stop when nothing new could
    be reached. Note: this graph is actually the automata recognizing
    our regexp, but we do not build it explicitely here.

    - [n] is the depth of our search, to convince Coq we'll stop someday
    - [explored] is a set of derivatives we've finished visiting :
      all their derivatives by a letter are in [explored] or [seen]
    - [seen] is a set of derivatives we still have to handle :
      we haven't checked yet whether their own derivatives are new or not.
